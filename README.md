The Employee Admin System is a web-based application designed for managing employee data in a simple, intuitive, and efficient manner. The system allows authorized administrators to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee records.Administrators can manage employee details such as First Name, Last Name, Position, and Salary. The system also features authentication to ensure that only authorized users (admins) can access and modify the employee data. Key features of the system include:

Admin Authentication: Only authorized admins can log in using a username and password.
1. Employee Management: Admins can add, view, edit, and delete employee records.
2. Responsive Design: The system is built with a mobile-friendly and responsive design using Bootstrap to ensure a smooth experience across devices.
3. Validation: Built-in input validation ensures that users provide correct data, and the system provides feedback when data is invalid.
4. Session Management: Admin sessions are managed to ensure that they stay logged in until they log out explicitly.

This application is built using ASP.NET Core MVC, Entity Framework Core, and Bootstrap for the frontend. The backend is powered by a SQL Server database to store employee and admin data securely.
